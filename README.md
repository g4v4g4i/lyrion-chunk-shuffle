This is a script to create a random queue in lyrion which plays from
each album in the queue 4 songs before moving to the next album and
so on, until no songs are left. My use case for this is when
checking out new music. For this I want a compromise between
randomization and coherence: I don't want to listen each album fully
(I am in discovery mode and like to jump between releases), but I
still want to spend sufficient time with one artist/album to emerge
into the sound and athmosphere of the release. A chunk size of 4 is
for me the sweet spot for this. The script additional provides an
album shuffle, since the lyrion album shuffle doesn't work for me.
